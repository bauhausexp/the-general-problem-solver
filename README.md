# The General Problem Solver Program [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/thundergolfer/the-general-problem-solver/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/thundergolfer/the-general-problem-solver) [![Issue Count](https://codeclimate.com/github/thundergolfer/the-general-problem-solver/badges/issue_count.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/thundergolfer/the-general-problem-solver)

Herbert Simon, J.C Shaw and Allen Newell's General Problem Solver Program (GPS) is one of the earliest AI program in existence, succeeding the [Logic Theorist Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Theorist) which arguably was the first AI program. The repo contains implementations of the GPS in multiple programming languages.

##### *I made a video working through the python implementation of this algorithm. It's available [here on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odLCF4v-yeM)*

### Languages Implemented So Far

* [Common Lisp](/general_problem_solver.lisp)
* [C](/general_problem_solver_C/) (In Progress...)  
* [C++](/gps_cpp/)
* [Go](/gps_golang/) (In Progress...)
* [Java](/general_problem_solver.java)
* [Javascript](/gps_javascript)
* [Python](gps_python/general_problem_solver.py)
* [Ruby](gps_ruby/general_problem_solver.rb) (In Progress...)
* [Typescript](gps_typescript/)

### Other Resources For Understanding

* [Description of the Program in Natural Language](/natlang_GPS_description.txt)
* [Norvig's retrospective on PAIP, and comments on the continuing relevance of LISP](http://norvig.com/Lisp-retro.html)
