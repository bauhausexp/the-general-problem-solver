# The General Problem Solver Program

Herbert Simon, J.C Shaw and Allen Newell's General Problem Solver Program (GPS) is one of the earliest AI program in existence, succeeding the [Logic Theorist Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Theorist) which arguably was the first AI program. The repo contains implementations of the GPS in multiple programming languages.
