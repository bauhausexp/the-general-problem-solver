begin:
- save initial conditions as "current state"
- try to achieve all goals

how to achieve all goals:
- for each goal:
  - try to achieve the goal
- if all goals were achieved, return success

how to achieve a goal:
- if goal is already met (in current state), return success (it's achieved)
- else, for each operator:
  - if operator's "add list" contains the goal,
    - try to apply the operator
    - if successful, return success
- if no operators were successful,
  - return failure

how to apply an operator:
- try to achieve all of the operator's preconditions (treat them as goals)
- if successful (all preconditions met),
  - mark the operator as "applied"
  - add conditions in the operator's "add list" to the current state
  - delete conditions in the operator's "delete list" from the current state
  - return success
- else,
  - return failure
